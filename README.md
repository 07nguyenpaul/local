# Local

This is my personal project for module 3 at Turing School of SoftWare and Design. This app targets anyone who loves
food and is convenient for new comers to Colorado. This app recommends the best restaurants to try and repeat from a local's
perspective.

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
This project is stored with Firebase.
